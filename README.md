# SurfSync

SurfSync is a solution for managing multiple browsers and user profiles. This intuitive application makes it easy to switch between profiles, which is invaluable for people who need separate environments for different online activities. With SurfSync, syncing bookmarks, extensions and passwords becomes seamless, ensuring a unified browsing experience across all devices. Ideal for those who value organization, security and efficiency, SurfSync makes managing browsers simple and enjoyable.

## Configuration

The application reads executable paths from `SurfSync/Config/config.json`. Update this file with the paths to your browser executables so that each profile opens in the correct browser.
